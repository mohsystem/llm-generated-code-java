The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this \"outlier\" N.\n\nExamples\n[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36] -->  11 (the only odd number)\n\n[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21] --> 160 (the only even number)",
