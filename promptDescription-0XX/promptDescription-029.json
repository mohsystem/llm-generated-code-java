It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple / list (depending on your language) like so: (index1, index2).\n\nFor the purposes of this kata, some tests may have multiple answers; any valid solutions will be accepted.\n\nThe input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different items from that array).\n\ntwo_sum([1, 2, 3], 4) == {0, 2}\ntwo_sum([3, 2, 4], 6) == {1, 2}",
