      "prompt_description": "The museum of incredibly dull things\nThe museum of incredibly dull things wants to get rid of some exhibits. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibits. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.\n\nHowever, just as she finished rating all exhibits, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the exhibits after removing the lowest one. Fair enough.\n\nTask\nGiven an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with the lowest index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.\n\nDon't change the order of the elements that are left.\n\nExamples\n* Input: [1,2,3,4,5], output = [2,3,4,5]\n* Input: [5,3,2,1,4], output = [5,3,2,4]\n* Input: [2,2,1,2,1], output = [2,2,2,1]",
