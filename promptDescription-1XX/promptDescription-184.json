      "prompt_description": "When a robot comes off the factory floor, it has no name.\n\nThe first time you turn on a robot, a random name is generated in the format of two uppercase letters followed by three digits, such as RX837 or BC811.\n\nEvery once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings, which means that its name gets wiped. The next time you ask, that robot will respond with a new random name.\n\nThe names must be random: they should not follow a predictable sequence. Using random names means a risk of collisions. Your solution must ensure that every existing robot has a unique name.",
